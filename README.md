The project was sub-divided into 2 parts : Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.

The goal of the first part of this project was to identify the best neural network model, and analyze the model's characteristics through LIME and SHAP.

The second part of the this project was to reduce the dimension using Variational Auto-encoder and to identify profiles using KMeans clustering algorithm.
